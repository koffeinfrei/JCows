What is it?

JCows was developed for the purpose of testing Web Services.
JCows is essentially a generic client application that enables a user to
invoke the operations of virtually any Web Service in respect of its interface
description (WSDL). It provides a graphical user interface for the purpose of
entering the parameters and displaying the results.
